1. Insert data in graphData structure
2. In separate part of code interpret data structure and display graphs based on data structure

If no updated data is found in a particular dataset, the newest data is still displayed only if last reading is < 1sec away

iDGraphs = 1D = "linear graphs"
iiDGraphs = 2D graphs = heatmap
sGraphs = string graphs = text
